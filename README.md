# **Car Evaluation using K-Nearest Neighbors**
# **Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning project that utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to evaluate cars based on multiple features. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses the car.data dataset.

# **Dataset**
The car.data file is used as the primary dataset for this project. It contains various attributes of cars, including buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, capacity, size of luggage boot, safety rating, and an overall class evaluation.

# **Features**
1. **Buying**: Buying price of the car.
2. **Maintenance**: Maintenance cost.
3. **Doors**: Number of doors.
4. **Persons**: Seating capacity.
5. **Lug_boot**: Size of luggage boot.
6. **Safety**: Safety rating.
7. **Class**: Overall evaluation of the car.

# **Prerequisites**
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

1. Python 3
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Open the Car_evaluation_using_K_nearest_neighbors.ipynb notebook and run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and predictions made by the K-Nearest Neighbors model.
